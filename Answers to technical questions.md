### How long did you spend on the technical test? 
I spent around 4 to 5 hours to to finish everything 

### What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
* Coverage for all major browsers, as its been written and tested on chrome only 
* Functional tests focusing all the sorting options like Distance,Ratings etc
* Error messages for invalid inputs like postcode, restaurant name etc

### What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?
In my opinion Selenium and Calabash are the most popular tools being used in automation. For languages I would say Java and Ruby

### How would you implement test automation in a a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?
Though it is based on business focus, but I would say we should distribute time for legacy as well as new features as per their value addition to business 

### How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?
* Less page loading times
* Adding and maintaining proactively all new food places
* Having saved their preferences to help them find out new restaurants they have not heard of
